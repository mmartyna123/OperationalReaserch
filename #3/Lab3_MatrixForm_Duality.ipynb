Specifically, you are asked to use the fundamental insight to build a final simplex tableau for each possible base. Therefore, you need first to initialize the data: c, b, A matrixes, and it is suggested to initialize the auxiliary matrix M defined as M = A + (concatenate) I (identity matrix). Note that the problem should be formulated in the augmented form. Then, you have to iterate over each possible base B, compute B-1, and other relevant parts for the simplex tableau.<br><br>\n",
