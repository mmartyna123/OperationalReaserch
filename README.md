# 📊 Operational Research Labs – PP Winter 2024/25

This repository contains my weekly mini-projects and lab notebooks from the **Operational Research** course at **Poznan University of Technology (Politechnika Poznańska)**, taken during the **winter semester of 2024/25**.

Each lab was focused on solving optimization problems using different techniques and modeling tools in Python – often using libraries like `PuLP`.

## 💡 What’s Inside?

Each lab is available in two formats:
- **`.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook (editable, runnable)
- **`.html`** – Static version for quick preview

Here’s what each lab covers:

| Lab | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Lab 2 | 🧮 PuLP Introduction | Formulating and solving LP problems using `PuLP`. |
| Lab 3 | 🔁 Matrix Form & Duality | Working with standard matrix form of LP and exploring dual problems. |
| Lab 4 | 🚛 Transportation Problem | Classic transportation optimization using LP methods. |
| Lab 5 | 🔌 Power Plant Optimization | Min-cost power generation while meeting demand. |
| Lab 8 | 🌳 Branch and Bound | Integer programming and solving with BnB method. |
